        <p>Sitting in the park,, on this day I was reading the short story "The City Born Great" in the book "HOW LONG 'TIL BLACK FUTURE MONTH?". When I reached this passage Alliance Universal sent Sambo and Quimbo (played by diffrent actors), to assert there authoritie.</p>

            <p>I'm full of meat and relaxed and thinking about stuff that ain't actually important-like how long Paulo will let me stay and whether I can use his address to apply for stuff-so I'm not watching the street. Until cold prickles skitter over my side. I know what it is before I react, but I'm careless again because I turn to look...Stupid, stupid, I fucking know better; cops down in Baltimore broke a man's spine for making eye contact. But as I spot these two the corner opposite the library steps-I notice something that actually breaks my fear because it's so strange.</p>

            <br /> Having established on September 06, 2019 that they were allowed to arrest me, they attempted to intimidate me once again. After telling them I was ready to go jail whenever they were, they proceeded to hover over me for over 30 minutes, until I got hungry and left.</p>
