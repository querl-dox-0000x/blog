            On this day I was reading the short story "The City Born Great" in the book "HOW LONG 'TIL BLACK FUTURE MONTH?".  When I reached this passage Alliance Universal sent Sambo and Quimbo (played by diffrent actors), to assert there authoritie.

             I'm full of meat and relaxed and thinking about stuff that ain't actually important-like how long Paulo will let me stay and whether I can use his address to apply for stuff-so I'm not watching the street.  Until cold prickles skitter over my side.  I know what it is before I react, but I'm careless again because I turn to look...Stupid, stupid, I fucking know better; cops down in Baltimore broke a man's spine for making eye contact.  But as I spot these two the corner opposite the library steps-I notice something that actually breaks my fear because it's so strange.

            Having established on September 06, 2019 that they were allowed to arrest me, they attempted to intimidate me once again.  After telling them I was ready to go jail whenever they were, they proceeded to hover over me for over 30 minutes, until I got hungry and left.
