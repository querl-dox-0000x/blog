                <div>This is to serve notice of targeted product tampering at the Whole Foods Durham location. &nbsp;With consumer data targeting hovering around the core of the Amazon business model, those same consumers who are being targeted, will NOT take kindly to know how Amazon and its subsidiaries are using that data, especially as it relates to their health and well being.&nbsp;

                <div>I cannot say if this behavior happens on a wide scale, but the boldness at which I have seen it done, makes me believe that it is not the first and only case. &nbsp;I also find it harder to believe that nobody in senior management is aware of what is going on, since it has been happening for over 6 months.

                <div>To assist the advanced surveillance apparatus at Amazon's disposal, I have supplied a unique identifier, to identify the purchases surrounding these actions. &nbsp;There should be no problem tracking the activities of those involved.
