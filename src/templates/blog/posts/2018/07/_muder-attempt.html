            I now know the texture of crushed glass between my teeth.<br>
            I now know how crushed glass feels on my tongue.<br>      
            I now know how it feels to have crushed glass stuck in my throat.<br>      
            I now know how it feels to have glass fragments moving through my body.<br>
            I now know how it feels as glass fragments dislodge and move further down my body.<br>

            For those familiar with the TV show OZ and thinking thats how they killed Prisoner number 95S604, Nino Schibetta.<br>
            +10 points<br>
            That was their joke.<br>
            Have to keep a sense of humor even when killing a man.<br>
