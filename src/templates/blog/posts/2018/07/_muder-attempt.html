                I now know the texture of crushed glass between my teeth.
                <br> I now know how crushed glass feels on my tongue.
                <br> I now know how it feels to have crushed glass stuck in my throat.
                <br> I now know how it feels to have glass fragments moving through my body.
                <br> I now know how it feels as glass fragments dislodge and move further down my body.

        <p> After being moved to a new cell block, my kiosk access no longer worked, because it "takes a few weeks when transferring between cell blocks". J. Smith (they were playing the name game, so was NOT his real name) delivered lunch. After taking a few bites, I noticed something wasn't right. Wiping my teeth my finger, I noticed there was glass.

            Pressed the intercom button.

            <strong>Clarence Daniels Jr.:</strong> There is a glass like substance in my food.
            <br> Conversation Over
            <br> Waited a minute, pressed the intercom button.

            When they opened the doors to bring trays back down, I kept mine. They count trays, and call you down if you don't bring your's down. They forgot about me. The jail was on lockdown, no phone access and visiting was suspended (that was word). After writing a simple note and putting it in front of the kiosk camera, lockdown was lifted. A few hours later, a corrections officer brought me my new roommate, and asked why I still had my try. I informed her there was glass in it. She played shocked, and took it with her. Didn't see her again.

        For those familiar with the TV show OZ and thinking thats how they killed Prisoner number 95S604, Nino Schibetta.

        <br> That was their joke.
        <br> Have to keep a sense of humor even when killing a man.
